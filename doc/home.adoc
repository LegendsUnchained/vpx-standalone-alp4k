== The Rules!

* *_READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS… TWICE!_* +
Make sure to take the time to fully ready through the wiki and other support threads too.
* *_DO NOT SHARE FILES!_* +
*DO NOT* share any `VPXS Launcher` files,
`Table Manager` files, `.vpx` files, `.directb2s` files, `.c7z` serum
files, `puppack` files, or `ROM` files with anyone. Doing so will
trigger the DRM and ban your account along with anyone you share files
with. Download files from official sources. The README links and the
Wizard download button links will point to official sources. *DO NOT*
share invite codes, if you do the entire invite chain gets banned.
Seriously, *DON’T DO IT*. There are no warnings, no second chances… once
banned, it cannot be reversed.
* *_BE RESPECTFUL!_* +
Everyone here is doing this in their spare time
and aren’t getting paid so be nice to one another. Please be respectful
if you get a message from the mods that you didn’t expect. There is
always a reason, make sure to listen.
* *_BE PATIENT!_* +
Participate as often as possible. This is the only
way to get Beta access. *DO NOT* ask for a Beta Invite and / or ask when
VPXS GL will be released!! Listen to the advice given to you, retry
installs if something goes wrong, don’t rush through setup. Your
problems are not everyone else’s problems. People are here to help, but
helping you is not everyone’s priority.
* *_DO NOT DM OR @mention PEOPLE!_* +
*DO NOT* DM people directly asking for help unless you are asked to do so. If you are stuck, read
through the Wiki one more time, and then ask for help in
`#general-vpx-chat` or `💬 vpx-beta-support`. If you are a Beta tester
using the `💬 vpx-beta-support` channel, the please be sure to read the
``How To Get Support'' post before submitting. It may take a while to
get a response, so please remember to be patient.
* *_HAVE FUN!_* +
The fun is _mandatory_! 😁 Once in the Beta,
participate in the optional weekly tournaments, share your successes,
and enjoy!
