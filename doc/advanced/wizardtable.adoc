== _Wizard Files (.yml)_


The `table.yml` file is the file needed to get a table onto the wizard.

This is where we use VPS and our repo info to fill out a set of fields,
that the wizard can then use.

In the `vpx-table` folder on your local repo cloned files, add a
`table.yml` file.

Below is each yml field explained, with an example, and any `gotchas'
that you need to know to use successfully!

....
########################
applyFixes
########################

Type:
------------
Array

Description:
------------
Applies fixes to the table. At the moment there is only BASS fix, but the field is open to future fixes

Example:
------------
applyFixes:
  - "bass"

Gotchas:
------------
- Like all arrays, make sure that each item in the list has 2 spaces at the start: '  - "bass"'
....

....
########################
backglassAuthorsOverride
########################

Type:
------------
Array

Description:
------------
This is an optional list so that you can manually set the Backglass Authors list.
Some backglasses don't have the authors in VPS.

Example:
------------
backglassAuthorsOverride:
  - "CoffeeAtJoes"

Gotchas:
------------
- Like all arrays, make sure that each item in the list has 2 spaces at the start: '  - "CoffeeAtJoes"'
- Currently there is a bug in the TM, if the backglass authors list is empty it'll break js/images.
  Set this field to fix that.
  You can set it to an empty field '  - ""' to get around it.
....

....
########################
backglassBundled
########################

Type:
------------
Boolean

Description:
------------
Set this field to 'true' if the backglass .directb2s file can be found in the same download as the .vpx file!
This removes the download button from the backglass, to simplify the process for the end user.

Example:
------------
backglassBundled: false

Gotchas:
------------
- The wizard will assume the file is in the vpx download.
  You cannot currently tell the wizard that it's in a different place like the rom/puppack download etc.
- If this field is set then 'backglassNotes' becomes mandatory.
  You need to explain where to find the .directb2s file.
....

....
########################
backglassChecksum
########################

Type:
------------
String

Description:
------------
This is the MD5 checksum value for the .directb2s file, taken from QuickHash.
See more info below on this page at "QuickHash (Checksums / Hash / MD5)"

Example:
------------
backglassChecksum: "8435FDA49C4DFC2D82B9B361E8AA1155"

Gotchas:
------------
- I know this sounds silly... but double check you've definitely selected the right file in QuickHash!
  Often the biggest mistake on these checksum fields were from getting a checksum of the wrong file :)
....

....
########################
backglassImageOverride
########################

Type:
------------
String

Description:
------------
This is a field used to fix broken images when using a 'backglass.png',
as we wont have a backglassVpsId to get the image from.

Example:
------------
backglassImageOverride: "https://virtualpinballspreadsheet.github.io/vps-db/img/b31KZ92B_b2s_1661263797943.webp"

Gotchas:
------------
- These image urls are the common ones to run into 'line-length' validation issues.
  If you do, check the "Line Length Issue" section below.
- Only needs to be used if your backglass image is broken or missing in the wizard.
- The image URL *has* to be from VPS, using a VPU or google image url will not work due to CORS.
....

....
########################
backglassNotes
########################

Type:
------------
String

Description:
------------
Notes for the backglass field, displayed next to the download button.
Put useful information here, or even just the file name to make things clear.
I recommend always setting it if you have a .directb2s file on the table.

Example:
------------
backglassNotes: "These are short notes..."

- or -

backglassNotes: >-
  Note: these are long notes that
  would go over the 120 character limit!
  Used the yml multi line, dont forget the 2 space indent!

Gotchas:
------------
- These notes fields are the common ones to run into 'line-length' validation issues.
  If you do, check the "Line Length Issue" section below.

########################
coloredROMBundled
########################

Type:
------------
Boolean

Description:
------------
Set this field to 'true' if the serum .c7z file can be found in the same download as the .vpx file!

Description:
------------
This is mandatory when 'coloredROMUrlOverride' is used.
It is how we know what the ROM should be called, so that we can
update the name if they upload it with and altered name like 'romname (1)' etc.
So this needs to be the romname, with no file extension like '.zip'.

Example:
------------
coloredROMVersionOverride: "baywatch"

Gotchas:
------------
- This has to match the rom name / romVersionOverride
- It is very very common to see someone accidently put the file extension
  in this field (for example coloredROMVersionOverride: "baywatch.zip")
  This WILL NOT work, you need to remove all file extensions. otherwise it will be named 'baywatch.zip.zip'
....

=== _YML PR Issues_

We have YML validation that runs whenever you make a PR that contains an
updated .yml file.

==== _Line Length Issue_

In the `.yamllint` we have `line-length: max: 120` set. So any lines
over 120 characters will flag an issue.

This can be updated in that file if 120 is too little, but there are a
couple ways around the issue anyway:

*_Using the multi line syntax to break up long lines. Great for note
fields._*

_Before:_

[source,yaml]
....
tableNotes: "this line is far too loooooooooooong!"
....

_After:_

[source,yaml]
....
tableNotes: >-
  This line is
  far too loooooooooooong!
....

[NOTE]
====
. Make sure to indent the lines by 2 spaces.
. You don’t need to use double-quotes here. If you do, they will be
displayed.
====

*_Using a comment to disable the check. Great for URLs_*

Adding this line above the line you want excluded from the check will
stop it checking the length.

[source,yaml]
....
# yamllint disable-line rule:line-length
romUrlOverride: "https://super-long-url-here"
....

== _Related Information_

There are some processes / sites / apps we need to have installed or be
familiar with!

=== _QuickHash (Checksums / Hash / MD5)_

This is the program we use to get MD5 hashs!

Install here: https://www.quickhash-gui.org/[QuickHash]

To get the hash, open up `QuickHash' on your PC.

Go to the `File` tab, and make sure `MD5` is selected:

https://virtualpinballspreadsheet.github.io/[Visual Pinball Spreadsheet]
is the website we use to get table ids, which then allow us to
programmatically get download URLs, images, authors, and other
information!

Use the table name from our repo, to search VPS (you might need to
simplify the name to find it)

Clicking it will open up the full details. This is where we are going to
get the majority of the information we need!

The table itself will have an overall ID:

And each component will also have an ID:

=== _GitHub Releases_

GitHub Releases are how we deploy wizard tables.

These can be done on your own repository!

First of all, we need to make sure your repo has actions enabled.

On your repository fork, click settings

Then click on menu:Actions[General]

image:../images/add_table_github_actions.png[]

And ensure that both `Actions permissions` and `Workflow permissions`
are set to their `enabled' state, underlined below:

Once that is sorted, you can go back to your yml files and commit them.
It's best to commit these under `main`.

Once committed, go back to your repo fork and on the right hand side
click `Create a new Release` (or `+ (x) Releases` if you’ve previously
made a release)

Then click `Draft a new release`

On this page, we need to give the release a name. Click the `create tag`
button, and in the text box enter a name. Something like `something-n`,
so that you can increment the number each release. I called mine
`wizard-testing-n`

When ready, click the button underneath the text box.

Then hit the `Publish release` button to submit it!

Thats it!

It will take a minute to build all the files it needs. You can see the
progress in the `Actions` tab.

To use the release, open the Table Manager, and the
`external/lu-tablemanager/` folder, add a new file called
`settings.json` and enter your repo info:

[source,json]
....
{
  "configrepo": "n-i-x/vpx-standalone-alp4k"
}
....

so for the cool kids, its:

[source,json]
....
{
  "configrepo": "TheOminousOsie/vpx-standalone-alp4k"
}
....

You can see that name in `Your Profile`, it's the same name you sent to
the Legends Unchained bot, and it's the name in the repo fork url!
