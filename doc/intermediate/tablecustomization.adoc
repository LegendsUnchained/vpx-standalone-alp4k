== DMD Customisation

=== Colour DMD

==== Full Colour ROM / Serum Files

VPXS currently is only compatible with `Serum' colour ROM files.

All the serum files can be found here:
https://vpuniverse.com/files/category/173-serum-dmd-colorizations/[VP
Universe - Serums]

If you are adding a table via the Table Manager, their will be a input
for `Serum'.

If you are adding a serum file to a table that you already have
installed on your USB:

[arabic]
. Open Table Manager
. Browse to the `vpx-table` folder via the `USB Root' tab.
. In the `pinmame` folder, add or navigate to a folder called `altcolor`
. In the `altcolor` folder, add a folder with the same name as your rom.
You can find the rom name via `external/vpx-table/pinmame/roms`
. In the folder that has the same name as the rom, add your `.cRZ` file.
This should also have the same name as the rom.

An example on the `Creature From The Black Lagoon' table:
`external/vpx-24/pinmame/altcolor/cftbl_l4/cftbl_l4.cRZ`

==== Change the Colour from Orange

The default orange on standard ROM games can be updated via a config
file!

If you installed your table via the wizard, you should already have the
coloured dmd.

If you manually installed the table, then you can update your ROM colour
by going to:

`external/vpx-table/pinmame/ini/romname.ini`

And in that file, update the `dmd_red`, `dmd_green`, and `dmd_blue`
colours. Each of these RGB can be a value between 0-255.

An example is Godzilla, in the file
`external/vpx-godzilla/pinmame/ini/godzilla.ini` I have changed the RGB
to green:

[source,ini]
....
[settings]
cheat=0
sound=1
dmd_red=7
dmd_green=168
dmd_blue=36
....

Which then looks like this:

=== How to add a custom DMD image to an empty DMD

If your DMD is empty (i.e. the table uses backglass scoring) then you
will see the default `Legends Unchained' logo as the image.

If you would like to replace this with another image, just add a
`dmd.png` file to your `external/vpx-table` folder!

The `dmd.png` image must:
- Be lowercase
- An Image size of 1920 x 1200
- Live right on the `vpx-table` folder root: `external/vpx-table/dmd.png`

Be sure to check the repo folders for a `dmd.png` file you can add to
your table!

== Loading Screen

=== Button Labels

You can change the button labels that appear during the tables loading
screen via a file!

All you need to do is add a `launcher.cfg` file to the root of your
`vpx-table` folder.

The `launcher.cfg` file looks like this:

[source,ini]
....
[buttonLabels]
dpadUp = "Up"
dpadDown = "Down"
dpadLeft = "Left"
dpadRight = "Right"
leftFlipper = "Left Flipper"
rightFlipper = "Right Flipper"
leftNudge = "Left Nudge"
rightNudge = "Right Nudge"
nudge = "Nudge"
start = "Start"
menu = "Menu"
....

So for deadpool, we added a `launcher.cfg` file to
`external/vpx-deadpool`, and edited it like so:
