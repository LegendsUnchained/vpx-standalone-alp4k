## Instructions

- Copy the contents of this repo folder to your USB drive
- Add your personalized launcher.elf and rename it to vpx-hardbody.elf
- Download the table & backglass zips above, extract them and copy them to external/vpx-hardbody folder
- Make sure (.vpx), (.directb2s), (.ini) and (.vbs) files are all named the same
- Place ROM zip file into vpx-hardbody/pinmame/roms folder. DO NOT UNZIP!
- Note: You can choose which backglass you prefer! I went with the classic faux mirror look, with the DMD on the glass!
- Note: The nudge buttons have been mapped to the save gates for ease of use.
- "We're here to *PUMP* you up!"
