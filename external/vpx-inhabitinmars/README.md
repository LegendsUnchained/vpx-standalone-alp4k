***** This table will not have a nudge feature as the nudge buttons are to stand up the flippers - pressing the nudge buttons (left or right) = stand up flippers - pressing flipper buttons = send them back (it will make sense once you play)*****

- This table is very unique and works in a very odd way. If you never played orbiter 1 then you might get overwhelmed by its oddity.
- Its uniqueness lies in the special gravity where the ball pushes and pulls away from pop bumpers and even goes all the way around the flippers.
