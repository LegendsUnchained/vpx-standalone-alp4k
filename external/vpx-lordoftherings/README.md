### 🎦 Puppack (Backglass Videos/Music):


1. Download the `lotr_1.0.1.zip` puppack from [Mega](https://mega.nz/file/7BdSXbQJ#ReZzIrRvpYc2nyHMQjZSp2s91fZ7ly5YOVy5c12zg4U) (by [takut](https://vpuniverse.com/profile/3434-takut/))
2. Create the folders `pupvideos/lotr` within the `external/vpx-lordoftherings` folder in the Table Manager
3. Extract the contents of the `lotr_1.0.1.zip` from the puppack zip, and put it in the `external/vpx-lordoftherings/pupvideos/lotr` folder. 
4. You should now have `external/vpx-lordoftherings/pupvideos/lotr/{puppack files}`
