
Yellow Submarine (2020)
This was my first board thanks to the generosity of JPsalas who allowed me to destroy his Speakeasy
so it deserved an update

new playfield, backglass with images of the movie, lights and rules
added extra ball, the light turns on by slot combination
added an interdimensional black hole that disappears the ball by opening a random portal above the plaifield expelling the ball, if I'm serious haha
Easy change of the ambient lightning: Hold down LeftMagnaSave and with RightMagnaSave it will switch between LUT images, from light to dark, 9 levels, 
and the selection will be saved for the table
added DOF, thanks Arngim 
Rules in the aprom	

Music mode that is activated in script (line 34: MusicMode = True)
The location for the music is as follows: Visual Pinball\Music\EM\Yellow
Those who had the previous version is the same music

Music must be "purchased / downloaded for copyright" and placed in Visual Pinball \ Music \ EM \ Yellow with these names or change them in the script (line 413)
YS1.mp3 to YS10.mp3 and the music you want for the launch presentation with the name intro.mp3

my recomendation is:
intro.mp3 ---> Beatles__Yellow_Submarine_In_Pepperland__INSTRUMENTAL.mp3
YS1.mp3   ---> Yellow Submarine	
YS2.mp3   ---> Hey Bulldog
YS3.mp3   ---> Eleanor Rigby
YS4.mp3   ---> Love You To
YS5.mp3   ---> All Together Now
YS6.mp3   ---> Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
YS7.mp3   ---> Think for Yourself
YS8.mp3   ---> Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
YS9.mp3   ---> With a Little Help from My Friends
YS10.mp3   ---> Nowhere Man

Right Magnasave turn on and change the music (MusicMode = True)
Left Magnasave stops the music
For those who do not have Magnasave, the start key turns on and changes the music but remember if you press it before 
the first ball is lost, it will activate the second player
